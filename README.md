## **Introduction**

This project demonstrates the application of modern technologies such as machine learning and computer vision to analyze, process, and extract meaningful insights from data. The project leverages the power of Python for scripting, SQL for database management, and popular libraries for machine learning and computer vision.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing scripts and models.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented various ML algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) using libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `TensorFlow`.
- **Computer Vision**: Image and video analysis using `OpenCV`, `PIL`, and deep learning models.
- **SQL**: Database management and data querying using `SQLite` or `MySQL`.
- **Data Processing**: `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Visualization**: Data visualization using `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and other plotting libraries.

## **Installation**

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cortana-Coders/AICI-Tasks.git
cd Assigment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## **Usage**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset using provided scripts in `src/data_processing.py` or load data using the notebooks.
2. **Machine Learning**:

   - Train models using the scripts in the `ml/` directory.
   - Models can be trained with different algorithms and hyperparameters, which can be fine-tuned via the command line or config files.

3. **Computer Vision**:

   - Use the `cv/` folder for image and video processing tasks.
   - Deep learning models can be applied for object detection, image classification, etc.

4. **SQL**:
   - Database management is handled via SQL scripts located in the `db/` folder.
   - Queries for retrieving, updating, and analyzing data can be executed directly.

## **Features**

- Data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation.
- Implementation of machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Computer vision techniques for object detection and recognition.
- Database interaction using SQL for storing and querying structured data.
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and experimentation.
