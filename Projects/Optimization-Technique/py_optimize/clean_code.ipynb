    "\n",
    "- Readability: Clean code is easy to read, which helps other developers understand your code quickly.\n",
    "- Maintainability: If your code is clean, it's easier to update, debug, and improve.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Clean code is essential for teamwork, especially when sharing code with others or working on large projects.\n",
    "- Error Prevention: When your code is clean and organized, you're less likely to introduce bugs. Now, letâ€™s explore some best practices that will help you write cleaner code in Python.\n",
